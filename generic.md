I wanted to create a simple chart that will help folks like my-few-years-younger-self make good college decisions. Specifically, I wanted to present data that will help teenagers understand whether the industry-wide benchmark, low acceptance rate, really is the right statistic to take into consideration when considering alternatives.



<b>Data:</b>
In order to diagnose correlation between acceptance rates, and expected income I had to get this data. Ideally, I was looking for a table with those columns, but of course it was harder than expected. So where could I get data from? 


<b>Scraping:</b>
I found a reliable source (Payscale) that presents expected income for recent graduates from many colleges. With the help of friends from StackOverflow I learned how to scrape CSS and got the data. I was able to get my hands on reliable acceptance rates (USNews) as well, and so I was ready to go and manipulate the data as much as I wanted. Or at least that's  what I thought...

<b>Fuzzy Names:</b>
Apparently, sometimes there are many names for the same institution. New York University, could be NYU, New-York University, "New-York University, New-York, NY",  written with CAPS or lowercase.  What a mess...

<b>The Core:</b>
The core of this project is where I match between very similar names of the same college, to create a tokenized database that will include acceptance rates and potential earnings per college. With Python, I was able to use a package called FuzzyWuzzy, that exists exactly for this purpose.

<b>Back and Forth:</b>
I played with this package a bunch of times, but it seemed like the algo wasn't sophisticated enough. I had more matches than items (one list was longer, and it matched more than once with the other list). I've written the technical details of how I solved the problem here.


<b>Finally: </b>
In front of you is the data, as neat as a pin. The chart is interactive so feel free to hover over your preferred dot.

The trend is quite obvious -  selective schools tend to lead to a higher expected income.**
Here's for another fun project, and great college-picking for you guys.

<b>Technical Details:

FuzzyWuzzy includes several versions of FuzzyMatch algos, all of which I tried.  With some trial and error, I ended up choosing a combination of fuzz.ratio  and a threshold score (90). The relevant snippet of code looks like this:

![fuzzy](assets/images/fuzzy1.png)

I know that one list contains only 280 items, while the other list was 960 items,  I knew that if I got a match for more than 280 items, then the sinceI started with fuzz.token_set_ratio - algo overfitted.  Starting with 556 matches I incrementally made progress.  After consideration of other algos that are based on phonetic similarity rather than graphic, I consulted a friend who suggested cleaning and tokenizing the data further before giving up on fuzzy. I ended up sticking to fuzzy and spending more time cleaning the data.

As always, all the code can be found on [GitHub.](https://github.com/oba2311/HigherEdu_Project)
