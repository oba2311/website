Almost-weekly quick thoughts on product strategy, design and UX.

<h3>Keeping score during Corona</h3>
<i>Posted on 01-06-2020.</i>

Users care about thier score. That might be obvious but apparently Google's fit team missed it somehow:

Product's core-followers would care a lot about their score, especially when it comes to personal benchmarks, and of course when it comes to such an intimate and important data like one's personal progress towards achieving better physical fit.

Alternative  metrics instead of # of steps could have been:
* allow users manual logging (so could be pushups, pull ups etc)
* alllow users to take videos of themsels (automatically count pushups for example using neural nets)
* allow users to keep accountable to each other so users log for other users.
* just to name a few options. 

Here's an example for what a small startup probably would have done better - being agile and keeping up with daily changes is much easier as a tiny company. It is really hard to maintain such culture when a company grows really fast, and here's one example shown.

<h3>Small incremebts that delight users</h3>
<i>Posted on 25-04-2020.</i>

With the immense promise that AI brings, it is easy to remember how minor increments could sometimes make a difference. Here I share a delightful moment for me as a user - when Google Keep added [autocomplete that works really well for groceries](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykarcz/2016/06/02/google-keep-auto-complete/#343cddcf72a5).

<h3>DataScience @ Gartner Innovation Center</h3>

This past summer I was lucky to work for Gartner, at their innovation center in Tel-Aviv, Israel (called "GICI"). I worked as a datascientist on three different projects: one was a BI-style project, one was on a recommendation system, and one focused on ways to leverage big-data.

GICI is a really unique place to work at. Decisions are all backed with data, all RD is driven by insights well-thought and structurally-considered. Above all of that, the place feels more like home than an office.

GICI is very open to employee's-led initiatives, so I was asked to give a short lecture regarding my focus on **Datascience for Social Good**.
You can find here the lecture (in 3 parts). I'm drawing on famous case-studies without going too much into technical details. Enjoy!
