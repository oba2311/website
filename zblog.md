<h3>Keeping score during Corona</h3>
<i>Posted on 01-06-2020.</i>

Users care about thier score. That might be obvious but apparently Google's fit team missed it this time.

</span>

Product's core-followers would care a lot about their score, especially when it comes to personal benchmarks, and of course when it comes to such an intimate and important data like one's personal progress towards achieving better physical fit.

Alternative  metrics instead of # of steps could have been:
* allow users manual logging (so could be pushups, pull ups etc)
* alllow users to take videos of themsels (automatically count pushups for example using neural nets)
* allow users to keep accountable to each other so users log for other users.
* just to name a few options. 

Here's an example for what a small startup probably would have done better - being agile and keeping up with daily changes is much easier as a tiny company. It is really hard to maintain such culture when a company grows really fast, and here's one example shown.

<h3>Small increments that delight users</h3>
<i>Posted on 25-04-2020.</i>

With the immense promise that AI brings, it is easy to forget how small increments could sometimes make a difference. Here I share a delightful moment for me as a user - when Google Keep added [autocomplete that works really well for groceries](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykarcz/2016/06/02/google-keep-auto-complete/#343cddcf72a5).

<h4>A quick drill-down explaining why autocomplete is an important UX component:</h4>
Considering that algorithmically the suggestions provided by the autocomplete are good:

* Users would feel like the porduct "gets them".
* Users can type less.Obviously, especially when it comes to forms.
* Autocomplete guides users - allowing both higher degree of assurance regarding a search query, and also some degree of serendipity.
* Autocopmlete reduces visual competition allowing users to focus on the search box when designed correctly.

For PMs looking into more details I would recommend the following resources:
1. [Great autocomplete UX keypoints](https://baymard.com/blog/autocomplete-design)
2. [Google's design guide including autocomplete chapter](https://services.google.com/fh/files/events/pdf_auto_healthcare_playbook.pdf)

I was immensly lucky to work with Lloyds Banking, one of the biggest banks in the UK during 2018-2019. One of the projects I was part of was aiming to automate mortgage application over the blockchain. 
<br>  
During this super interesting project I worked with representatives from all 10 biggest banks in the UK as well as the FCA and the Bank of England - all in the same room for a couple of months to come up with a solution.
<br>  
I co-authored [a whitepaper](https://www.fca.org.uk/innovation/regtech/digital-regulatory-reporting) presenting the solution proposed.

<h2>2017 </h2>
<h3>DataScience @ Gartner Innovation Center</h3>
<i>Posted on 03-11-2017.</i>


This past summer I was lucky to work for Gartner, at their innovation center in Tel-Aviv, Israel (called "GICI"). I worked as a datascientist on three different projects: one was a BI-style project, one was on a recommendation system, and one focused on ways to leverage big-data.

GICI is a really unique place to work at. Decisions are all backed with data, all RD is driven by insights well-thought and structurally-considered. Above all of that, the place feels more like home than an office.

GICI is very open to employee's-led initiatives, so I was asked to give a short lecture regarding my focus on _Datascience for Social Good_.
You can find here the lecture (in 3 parts). I'm drawing on famous case-studies without going too much into technical details. Enjoy!
