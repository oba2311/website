<h3 id="content">Product Strategy & UX</h3>
I love working with early-stage startups in various capacities as a consultant. My unique global experience with product and data allows me to help startups that I love ask the right questions to grow faster and better.

Broad areas I can help with are listed below:  
1. **Product strategy** (product scoping, setting and tracking the right analytics, developing product principles).
2. **Growth strategy** (new user onboarding, landing pages, creating a GTM strategy).
3. **Developing a product roadmap** (and setting metrics for your team to make your CFO happy again).
4. **Product interviewing** (and career planning).
