<h3 id="content">Product Strategy & UX</h3>
<p>I love working with early-stage startups in various capacities as a consultant. My unique global experience with product and data allows me to help startups that I love ask the right questions to grow faster and better.

Broad areas I can help with are listed below:

1. Growth strategy (especially new user onboarding, landing pages)
2. Product strategy (building strong user empathy, developing product principles, product scoping)
3. Building high-functioning teams (effective processes, weekly rituals, etc.)
4. Developing a product roadmap and setting great OKRs/metrics for your team that and make your CFO happy again.
5. Product interviewing and career planning:
